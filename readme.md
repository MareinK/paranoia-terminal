# Paranoia HIT - TCHWRK Terminal

This repository contains the client and server code for a puzzle website, one of around 150 puzzles that were created as part of a Dutch Scouting camp known as the [Paranoia HIT](http://paranoia.50noord.nl/). The original website, in the `original` branch, required that participants were provided with crucial information via means outside of the website itself. A standalone version, which provides this information internally, is present on the `main` branch, and can be played.
